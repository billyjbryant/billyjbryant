# Hi, I'm Billy!

## About Me!

> I'm a self proclaimed foodie, I love cooking in my free time and trying out new recipes. My Instagram is a mixture of Food, Tech, Cars and Memes! My GitHub commits will lead you to believe I do nothing, maybe I should work on that. Most of my contributions are in private repos or published to internal repos at work. I'm part of a small start-up, called TotiLight, that builds light based art installations for galleries and public displays, its amazing and challenging work that I enjoy! Until 2018, I had lived in Louisville, KY for 11 years, prior to that I lived in Birmingham, AL. I moved to Seattle, WA in September of 2018 to take on an exciting new role with [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), but I recently took on a new opportunity with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). I'm married to the love of my life, Sonya; together, we have two cats, who despite our best efforts are absolutely our babies. I'm always willing to share knowledge and dying to learn something new every day. If you want to reach out, please do, I'm pretty much an open book, ask me anything!
